> Families can be difficult - but the data describing them doesn't need to be

Create and summarise family tree GEDCOM files using tidy dataframes.

The package is part of the `gedcompendium` ecosystem of packages. This ecosystem enables the handling of `tidyged` objects (tibble representations of GEDCOM files), and the main package of this ecosystem is [`tidyged`](https://jl5000.github.io/tidyged/).


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/allhex.png")
```


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jl5000/tidyged")
```

## Example

The intent is to allow the user to import GEDCOM files or create them from scratch using a `ggplot2` type interface; starting with a base GEDCOM object (with only a header and trailer section) and adding records as you would add layers to a ggplot object (but instead using the pipe operator, %>%).

An example is below:

```{r example}
library(tidyged)

tg <- gedcom(subm("Jamie Lendrum"), gedcom_description = "The Skywalker family", gedcom_copyright = "None") %>%
  add_indi(sex = "M", indi_notes = "The central character in the Star Wars Skywalker Saga") %>%
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(given = "Anakin", surname = "Skywalker"), type = "birth") %>%
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(prefix = "Darth", given = "Vader"), 
                 type = "given") %>%
  add_indi(sex = "F", indi_notes = "Queen of Naboo") %>%
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(given = "Padme", surname = "Amidala"), 
                 type = "birth") %>% 
  add_indi(sex = "F") %>% 
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(given = "Leia", surname = "Skywalker"), 
                 type = "birth") %>%
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(prefix = "Princess", given = "Leia", surname = "Organa"), 
                 type = "adoptive") %>% 
  add_indi(sex = "M") %>%
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(given = "Luke", surname = "Skywalker"), 
                 type = "birth") %>% 
  add_indi(sex = "M") %>% 
  add_indi_names(name_pieces(given = "Obi-Wan", nickname = "Ben", surname = "Kenobi"), 
                 type = "birth") %>% 
  add_famg(husband = "Anakin", wife = "Padme", children = c("Luke", "Leia")) %>%
  activate_indi("Anakin") %>% 
  add_indi_association("Obi-Wan", association = "Master") %>% 
  add_indi_fact("death", age = "45y", cause = "Killed by son Luke",
                fact_place = place(name = "Second Death Star", notes = "Orbiting Endor System")) %>% 
  add_indi_fact("religion", descriptor = "Jedi") %>% 
  add_indi_fact("possession", descriptor = "Lightsaber") %>%
  add_note("Based on Star Wars") %>% 
  add_sour(short_title = "Star Wars", title = "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope") %>% 
  add_repo("The Skywalker Saga") %>% 
  add_media(file_reference = "XYZ", format = "JPEG")

print(tg, n = Inf)
```


Just like a ggplot object requires aesthetics, a GEDCOM file requires details of a submitter. If no submitter details are given, the username is used.

Within the package, GEDCOM files are represented as a sub-class of tibble known as `tidyged` objects, allowing easy manipulation and exploitation of existing `tidyverse` infrastructure.

A number of functions are available to provide summaries of `tidyged` objects:

```{r}
num_indi(tg)
num_famg(tg)

str(tg)
summary(tg)

df_indi(tg) %>% knitr::kable()
df_famg(tg) %>% knitr::kable()
```

This package allows limited editing of `tidyged` objects (adding/removing records, as well as the addition of some record substructures). Editing of existing records is made possible through 'activation' (much like the `tidygraph` package). When a record is created, it automatically becomes the active record, through an object attribute. Record editing functions then act on this record. Other records can be activated through a series of `activate_*()` functions.
